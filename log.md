# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Implemented Redux Forms

**Thoughts:** I had a lot of trouble with Redux Forms but I finally figured out the problem and the forms are live. Just need to work on getting the data from the Redux Forms

### Day 2: November 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Retreived Redux Forms Data

**Thoughts:** I was able to overcome a difficult time retreiving the input data from ReduxForms wuth the current functionality. An assist from the creator of BuyChoiceApp was all I needed and I'm ready to POST the data to the API. Also, started the day off with some Edabit challenges to get the juices flowing.

**Today's Progress**: Went over Edabit challenges with JS group, Worked more on BuyChoiceApp

**Thoughts:** I was not able to progress further with BuyChoiceApp (with limited time today) but was able to learn a bit more about redux and reducers which may help in the future.
